# Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly Detection is the technique of identifying rare events or observations which can raise suspicions by being statistically different from the rest of the observations. Such “anomalous” behaviour typically translates to some kind of a problem like a credit card fraud, failing machine in a server, a cyber attack, etc.
